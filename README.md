<h2>Now we want contributions on the migration of the Rentalog's tech stack to React js and Next js</h2>
<p>The migration to React.js and Next.js offers several advantages for Rentalog:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance Boost:</strong> React.js enables efficient rendering and updates, resulting in a snappier and more responsive user interface.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> With React.js, we can build interactive components that provide a seamless and engaging experience for our users.</li>
  <li><strong>Code Maintainability:</strong> React.js promotes a component-based architecture, making the codebase modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.</li>
  <li><strong>Server-side Rendering:</strong> Next.js introduces server-side rendering, leading to faster initial page loads and improved search engine optimization (SEO).</li>
  <li><strong>Scalable State Management:</strong> React.js, combined with libraries like Redux or React Context, provides efficient state management for handling complex application states</li>
  <li><strong>Rich Ecosystem:</strong> Migrating to React.js and Next.js opens up a vast ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community support for future development and enhancements.
  </li>
</ul>
